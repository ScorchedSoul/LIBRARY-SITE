    <h2><strong>What do we do?</strong></h2>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>A digital library, also called an online library, an internet library, a digital repository, or a digital
        collection is an online database of digital objects that can include text, still images, audio, video, digital
        documents, or other digital media formats or a library accessible through the internet. </h3>

    <h2><strong>FEATURES OF E-LIBRARY</strong></h2>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>No physical boundary: The user of a digital library need not to go to the library physically; people from all
        over the world can gain access to the same information, as long as an Internet connection is <br>
        Round the clock availability: A major advantage of digital libraries is that people can gain access 24/7 to the
        information. <br>
        Multiple access: The same resources can be used simultaneously by a number of institutions and patrons. This may
        not be the case for copyrighted material: a library may have a license for "lending out" only one copy at a
        time; this is achieved with a system of digital rights management where a resource can become inaccessible after
        expiration of the lending period or after the lender chooses to make it inaccessible (equivalent to returning
        the resource). <br>
        Information retrieval: The user is able to use any search term (word, phrase, title, name, subject) to search
        the entire collection. Digital libraries can provide very user-friendly interfaces, giving click able access to
        its resources. <br>
        Preservation and conservation: Digitization is not a long-term preservation solution for physical collections,
        but does succeed in providing access copies for materials that would otherwise fall to degradation from repeated
        use. Digitized collections and born-digital objects pose many preservation and conservation concerns that analog
        materials do not. Please see the following "Problems" section of this page for examples. <br>
        Space: Whereas traditional libraries are limited by storage space, digital libraries have the potential to store
        much more information, simply because digital information requires very little physical space to contain them
        and media storage technologies are more affordable than ever before. <br>
        Added value: Certain characteristics of objects, primarily the quality of images, may be improved. Digitization
        can enhance legibility and remove visible flaws such as stains and discoloration.</h3>
